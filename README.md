# Project-Voices
Project Voices is a prototype website created for the Social Inno Fest Hackathon 2018. It aims to assist vulnerable families to reintegrate
back into society by helping familites to break the communication barrier attributed to social stigma. Project Voices provides
a platform for vulnerable families to suggests events that they wish to take part in with members of their communities.
